      <p class="title">THE FROGS</p>
      <p>
        In the late 1700s, for about 6 years, Earth's environment had the ideal
        conditions that allowed frogs to evolve to have a society as regal and
        complex as human society. A little girl discovered The Frogs
        civilization when she went to her nearest lake to take some tadpoles and
        raise them for her science project. The Frogs were initially indignant
        and traumatized by her intentions, but decided to explain their feelings
        calmly, as they recognized she was a child in human years. She was won
        over by their small world, and became The Frogs' friend. Her strong
        committment to the success of their society earned her the title of The
        Ally.
